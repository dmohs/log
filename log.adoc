The first commits to this will be pretty scattered. As my usage becomes more consistent, commits will match the approximate time of the activity.

Spent time this morning investigating WebRTC. I was really looking for a way to monitor network connection health so I could display this on my mobile apps. This is part of my ideas around providing more diagnostic information within my apps. The debug view in Powercal was my first dive into this.

When I host my next Engineering Practice Fridays session, I want to try remote mob programming. Zoom and Bluejeans are candidates to replace Google Hangouts to increase the video chat quality. Teletype for Atom and Tuple (Mac only remote pairing tool) were suggested by Isaac for screen sharing tools.

What's left is a way to switch drivers. Committing to a branch has variable friction. If the mob programming use case wasn't considered by the team, it's quite likely that even branch commits have pre-commit hooks that could reject work in progress. I am currently experimenting with a tar plus Google Bucket solution that should reliably work for just about any setup. My Broad `dmohs` repo is the first attempt.
